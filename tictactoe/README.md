# Tic-tac-toe
## What:
This was one of my favourite projects. You create a tictactoe board (any size, not restricted to just 3x3) and play against a bot. 

## What's happening?
Everything is in one file. I know that this code would have been much more elegant as multiple objects, but I liked coding this for the logic of it.

You're playing against a bot.
I had to draw the board using ASCII, use scanner to get user inputs, draw inputs on board, program the bot behaviour, and keep track of the winner.
Everything is pretty much explained in the code comments.

## To do
I might take this and make an actual game for android one day. Could be fun.
