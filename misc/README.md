# Miscellaneous one file projects:
these are the very first programs I wrote, so they are very simple.

### Day of the week:
Given a year, month, and date, which day of the week was it?

### ISBN:
Making sure that an ISBN is valid ( a multiple of 11). I used only 5 digits, where you are given the first 4 and the program finds the last one. In real life the ISBN has more than 5 digits.

### JudgeScore: 
Olympics style scoring: out of four integer scores, throw out lowest and highest then average the rest.

### Multiples:
Takes two integers, and prints whether the first one is a multiple of the second

### NearestToTen:
Takes two integers, and prints which one is closer to 10.

### ThreeDice:
A program that rolls three dice whose largest value is specified by the user via args.
