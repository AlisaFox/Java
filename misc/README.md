#####Miscellaneous one file projects:
these are the very first programs I wrote, so they are very simple.

ISBN: making sure that an ISBN is valid ( a multiple of 11). I used only 5 digits, where you are given the first 4 and the program finds the last one.

Dayoftheweek: Given a year, month, and date the program tells which day of the week it was

JudgeScore: Olympics style scoring: out of four integer scores, throw out lowest and highest then average the rest.
