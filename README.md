# Java
Java is the second language I learnt, but also probably the one I am most familiar with.
So a lot of these projects are on the simpler side.
Going in order, we have:

## 1. Buildings
Playing around with objects. Created a tree of buildings, which have the attributes height and age, year when they should be repared and how much it would cost. This is basically a tool for a buildings manager

## 2. Ciphers
This was one of my earlier projects. I programmed three ciphers and their deciphers (when given the key). The ciphers were caesar, vigenere, and transposition. 

## 3. Hotel
This is a hotel booking system. Once you launch the script a menu appears with options to book rooms / view availability / see the bill / etc. Lot's of objects in this one as well.

## 4. Mexico
This is a [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_(game)). Mexico is an elimination-style dice game, in which two players (Giulia and David) agree to play a set number of rounds. Usually money is bet. This is a stimulation, so the code tells you whether Giulia or David wins.

## 5. Misc
Here we have a bunch of simple simple small code bits. For example:

#### ISBN:
making sure that an ISBN is valid ( a multiple of 11). I used only 5 digits, where you are given the first 4 and the program finds the last one.

#### Dayoftheweek: 
Given a year, month, and date the program tells which day of the week it was

#### JudgeScore:
Olympics style scoring: out of four integer scores, throw out lowest and highest then average the rest.

and there are a couple of other ones

## 6. Tic-tac-toe
This might actually be my favourite project. It was also one of the first ones I made, so I didn't use any fancy stuff like objects and classes. It was just good old fashioned logic. Basically here you play a game of tic--tac-toe against a bot on a board of any size you want.

## 7. Twitter 
This is a fake "twitter". It takes a file of messages, and can do multiple things. It can bubblesort according to the time of the message. Or it can find the most used word, or the hottopic. Or it can check if a message exists at all in a tweet.

## 8. Warehouse
This is a warehouse. This project developed my understanding of object oriented programming. We started with box, the boxes are on shelves, and shelves are in a warehouse. We also have urgent box, which is a subtype of box, so that we have different shippint lists / priorities. I used the merge-sort algorithm, to reorganize the boxes and the shelves according to their heights to optimize the warehouse.
