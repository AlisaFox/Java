# Mexico 
## What:
This [is an elimination-style dice game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_(game)), in which two players (Giulia and David) agree to play a set number of rounds. "Money" is bet. This is one of the simpler projects.

## What's happening?
This is a stimulation of a game.

Each player has a buy-in. There is also a set amount of money that they loose if they loose a round.
In one round, each player rolls two dices, and compare their scores (there are special rules of the game for the rolls 21, 12, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, and 66).
Whoever looses their money first winds.

All the functionality is in the `Mexico.java` file, the other one is a tester.

## To do:
Need to reorganize game logic. For example Giulia checks her dice first, and if she has a 12 she winds the round, although David might also have a 12 / 21.
